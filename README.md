**CSIRO Transition to Renewables Website Front-end Code**

Steps to host website locally
  1. Download all files in this repository as a zip file. Link to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/BigBrother333/SCIF3000/tree/main
  2. Open the unzipped folder in the code editor of your choice (I'm using Visual Studio Code in the demonstration video)
  3. Download and install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. Here is a link on how to do this: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
  4. Make sure you're in the SCIF3000-main directory, run the command 'npm install' in the terminal to install the relevant node packages.
  5. After all packages are finished installing, run 'npm start' in the terminal and the website will start on your device.
