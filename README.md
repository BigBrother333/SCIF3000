**CSIRO Transition to Renewables Website Front-end Code**

Steps to host website locally
  1. Download all files in this repository as a zip file
  2. Open the unzipped folder in the code editor of your choice (I'm using Visual Studio Code in the demonstration video)
  3. If you haven't already downloaded and installed Node.js and npm, do this. Here is a link on how to do this: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
  4. While in the SCIF3000-main directory, run the command 'npm install' in the terminal to install the relevant node packages.
  5. Run 'npm start' in the terminal and the website should start on your device.
